# Stepped-Impedance-Low-Pass-Microstrip-Filter
This is a design procedure of Stepped-Impedance Low-Pass Microstrip filter design.
I have designed the filter for some given specifications.

  1.Maximally flat response
  2.Pass-band gain between 0 to -2dB for frequency(f) < fp = 1 GHz
  3.Minimum stop-band attenuation for frequency(f) > fs = 1.8 GHz
  4.FR4 substrate with thickness of 1.58 mm
  5.Copper conductors with thickness of 35 um
  6.Filter impedance of 50 ohm
  7.minimum width of microstrip line = 0.203 mm
