# Stepped-Impedance-Low-Pass-Microstrip-Filter
This is a design procedure of Stepped-Impedance Low-Pass Microstrip filter design.
I have designed the filter for some given specifications.
  Maximally flat response
  Pass-band gain between 0 to -2dB for frequency(f) < fp = 1 GHz
  Minimum stop-band attenuation for frequency(f) > fs = 1.8 GHz
  FR4 substrate with thickness of 1.58 mm
  Copper conductors with thickness of 35 um
  Filter impedance of 50 ohm
  minimum width of microstrip line = 0.203 mm
